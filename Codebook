Codebook for COURSERA Getting and Cleaning Data course project

The result of this codebook is "SecondData.txt" of this repository.
README.txt provides you with a helpful background to understand this data set.

SecondData.txt: separated by space, the first row contains the names of the 437 variables, each row from the second row is for each subject and each activity
Subject: identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30
Activity: identifier, string with 6 possible values
 #1=WALKING, 2=WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3=WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4=SITTING, 5=STANDING, 6=LAYING
Measurements: floating-point values between -1 and 1
 #class: time-domain signals(starting with t), frequency-domain signals(starting with f)
 #signals are measured in the X, Y and Z directions
Features: names of measurements

Source Data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The transformation applied to the source data are as follows:

Training and Test sets were merged into one data set.
Measurements on mean and standard deviation were extracted to separate data sets (mean, std).
Activity identifiers were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. 1->WALKING)
Variable names (column names) were replaced with descriptive variable names with features.txt.
Mean of each measurement was calculated by each subject and each activity.

Please refer to run_analysis.R for detailed code.
